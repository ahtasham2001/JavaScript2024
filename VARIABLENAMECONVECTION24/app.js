// Variable/Function naming conventions
// Variable naming is one of the most important parts of coding, yet it's often overlooked by many. While it doesn't directly impact a code's efficiency, it significantly enhances readability and code quality. Clear and meaningful variable names facilitate easier debugging and ultimately contribute to the overall improvement of code quality.

// Types of naming conventions
// There are numerous variable naming conventions in the coding world, but among the most important are :

// a) Camel Case

// b) Pascal Case

// c) Snake Case

// d) Kebab Case


// Camel Case
// Camel case is a variable naming convention used almost everywhere during variable naming where words in a phrase are combined without spaces.

// In camel case, the first letter of each word in a phrase is capitalized except for the first word, which starts with lowercase. There are no spaces between the words.


// Pascal Case
// Pascal case is another naming convention we use frequently to combine the words in a phrase without using spaces. It is similar to the 'Camel Case' convention just with a slight difference.

// In this naming convention each word in a phrase is capitalized including the first word.

// Examples of Pascal Case


// Snake Case
// Another very famous variable naming convention is 'Snake Case' convention. This naming convention is most preferred in programming languages like Python.

// In snake case, all the words of a phrase are written in lowercase and separated by underscores("_") instead of spaces.

// Examples of Snake Case

// Kebab Case
// The kebab case is almost similar to the snake case where all the words in a phrase are written in lowercase.

// The only difference between snake case and kebab case naming convention is, In kebab case the words in a phrase are separated by hyphens("-").
